#### The Comparative Method

The comparative method refers to *"the method of comparing different societies or groups within the same society to show whether and why they are similar or different in certain respects."* By comparing of differences across societies or groups within the same society, one can find clues in order to understand the societies in a better manner. This method isn't exclusive only to sociology rather it is an universal one since it is based upon reasoning. There are various Sociologists who has used this method in their work and thus made it popular in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. For example,

[**Durkeheim**]({{< ref "emile-durkheim.md" >}}): He has explained the comparative method on three different occasions which are as follows:[^1]

- In his "The Rules of Sociological Method", he opined that the sociological explanation consists entirly in the establishment of casual connections. It is different from establishing casual connections in natural sciences since in the case of natural science, the casual connections could be more easily established due to facility of experiment while that is not applicable in social science. Since such direct methods are not applicable, one has to resort to indirect methods such as comparative method.  
- In his work, "Division of Labor in Society", he compared the legal systems of different societies at the same time and their different levels of devlopment. He proposed the hypothesis that **increase in the division of labor is accompanied by a change in social integration.**
- Further, in his study, "Suicide", he showed that the suicide rate varied inversely with the degree of social cohesion and with the degree of stability of moral norms. 

Thus, by employing this method, it may be possible to explain the siginificance of a custom or practice, though it varies from one society to another, by studying the motives behind it. For example, this method can be used in orer to explain correlations between crime and urbanisation, between family size and social mobility etc. 

**Limitations:** Critics have pointed out that, what appearsupericially to be similar institutions may, in fact, be very different in the societies being considered. There are practical difficulties that one needs to face while employing this method. Even though there are limitations of the comparative method, due to the absnece of any experimental method this does serve the purpose.

#### The Historical Method

It refers to the study of events, processes and institutions of past civilizations for the purpose of finding the origins or antecendents (a person's ancestors or family and social background) of contemporary social life and thus understanding its nature and working. It is based on the idea that our present forms of social life, traditions, cultures, beliefs, values have their roots in the past and hence, one can explain them in a deeper manner when they are traced back to the origin. This method could be regarded as the base upon which historical sociology was born. 

The historical apporach has two main forms. 

- The first one is influenced by biological theory of evolution: It was mainly followed by [Comte]({{< ref "auguste-comte.md" >}}), [Spencer]({{< ref "herbert-spencer.md" >}}) and [Hobhouse]({{< ref "leonard-trelawny-hobhouse.md" >}}). 
- By economic interpretation:

#### The Statistical Method

The term **statistical method** refers to the method that is used to measure social phenomena mathematically. It may be regarded as the method of _collecting_, _analysing_ and _interpreting_ numerical information about social aggregates. The statistical method have become essential from 17<sup>th</sup> century onwards in terms of utlizing statistics in order to measure different social phenomena. It could be used in two different ways. 
- application of statistical methods to social and non - social problems. 
- collection of numerical data in relation to the problems. 

It is an important tool in research in the sense that it can be effectively used in issues or problems which involves measurements or numerals. For example, studies relating to birth and death, divorces and marriages, crime and suicide etc. statistics can provide various insights. Useful information can also be obtained by the application of this method in studies pertaining to migration, economic condition, standard of living, public opinion etc. 

**Limitations of statistical methods:** 

- The collection of numerical information about issues oe problems can not be made via direct observation. It has to be done through surveys which invovles questionaries. These surveys have their own limitations and hence overall impacts the effectiveness of the statistical method. 
- The conclusion of a statistical method revolves around feedback from the respondents which were interviewed. Depending upon the circumstances, it may yield results which may deviate from the real scenario. 
- social statisticians are often interested in analysis of data, which can be ordered and not measured.
