### Introduction

Bronisław Malinowski (b. 1884–d. 1942) is arguably the most influential anthropologist of the 20th century, certainly for British social anthropology. 

### Works

In 1914, he began his research in South Seas. Officially designated an “enemy alien”, he was not to return to Europe until after the war. He spent almost two years in the Trobriand Islands off the east coast of New Guinea, doing the long-term fieldwork that was to revolutionise anthropological research methods.

Malinowski’s study of a system of exchange of *shell jewellery* around a circuit of far-flung islands, known as the **“kula ring”**, formed the basis of his best-known work, **Argonauts of the Western Pacific (1922)**. **Argonauts** showed how the exchange of objects without any apparent use value was a way of facilitating trade, negotiating status and extending relationships. The exchange functioned, Malinowski suggested, as a surrogate for warfare.
