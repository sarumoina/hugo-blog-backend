#### Various definitions of Language

- *There is no mode of action, no form of emotion that we do not share with the animals. It is only by language that we rise above them.* Oscar Wilde
- *Language is that system by which sounds and meanings are related. (Fromkin and Rodman, 1974)*
- *Language is a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions and desires by means of voluntarily produced symbols.* (E. Sapir, 1911)
- *A language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which the members of a society interact in terms of their local culture.* (G. Trager, 1949)
- *A language is a set (finite or infinite) of sentences, each finite in length and constructed of a finite set of elements.* (N. Chomsky, 1957)
- *Language is a process of free creation; its laws and principles are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of generation are used is free and infinitely varied. Even the interpretation and use of words involves a process of free creation.* (N. Chomsky, 1983)
- *Language is the institution whereby humans communicate and interact with each other by means of habitually used oral - auditory arbitrary symbols.* (R.A.
Hall, 1964)
- *Audible, articulate meaningful sounds as produced by the action of the vocal organs.* (Websterâ€™s Third New International Dictionary, Vol.2, 1971)
- *Language is the most sophisticated and versatile means available to human beings for the communication of meaning.* (Brown, 1984)
- *Language is patterned system of arbitrary sound signals, characterized by structure dependence, creativity, displacement, duality, and cultural transmission.*
(Aitchison, 1987).

#### The origins of language

##### The divine source

This theory was more prevalent in the early part of 18<sup>th</sup> century. According to it, man was created and at the moment of his creation, speech was provided to him as a divine gift. Lots of experiments were done over the course of time where the hypothesis seems to be that, if human infants are allowed to grow up without hearing any language around them, then they would spontaneously begin using the original god given language. Though, experiments do not confirm this hypothesis. 

##### The natural sound source

According to this hypothesis, primitive words could have been imitations of the natural sounds which early human heard from their surrounding. The fact that all modern languages have some words which closely resemble with some natural sound, this theory did gain many support through out the years. In English, e.g. *splash*, *bang*, *boom*, *bow-wow* etc are such type of words. 

> **Bow Wow theory:**
> A bow-wow theory is any of the theories by various scholars, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Gottfried Herder, on the speculative origins of human language. [Max muller]({{< ref "max-muller.md" >}}) who coined this term was critical of this theory. 

This theory is also known as [**Onomatopoeic**]({{< ref "onomatopoeia.md" >}}) or [**Echoic**]() theory.

##### The Social interaction source
Also known as **yo-he-ho** theory, postulates that the sounds of a person involved in physical effort could be the source of our language. It can be especially significant when that physical effort invovles several people and the interaction has to be coordinated. So it can be assumed that early humans might have developed various sounds that were being used while they were doing heavy works such as lifting or carrying large trees etc. This theory also takes account social context in to consideration while the origin of language, a medium of communication is being formed. It is safe to assume that early humans used to live in groups since it gives them better opportunity to survive against any adversaries. While living in a group, for their day to day tasks, they must have developed some sounds which could mean some prmitive actions.
